# Data Analysis of Formula 1 2020 Season
I gathered the data from the formula1 website.
formula1.com (primary data source)
The following datasets can be found in the file:
season_calender.csv
season_drivers.csv
season_raceResults.csv
I uploaded the datasets into Excel and started the analysis.
You can find the analysis by clicking on the Excel file.
Also, I created a presentation in powerpoint to highlight my findings for this analysis.
