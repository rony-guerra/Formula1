# Data Analysis of Formula 1 2020 Season
I gathered the data from the formula1 website.
formula1.com (primary data source)

I uploaded the datasets into Excel and started the analysis.
You can find the analysis by clicking on the Excel file.
Also, I created a presentation in powerpoint to highlight my findings for this analysis.
